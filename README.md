# PushEd
Or shortly just PEd, is a 2D/3D level editor for GameMaker: Studio 1.4, originally released by our team [BlueBurn](http://blueburn.bluefile.cz/) in 2014 as a paid extension. Now, on the sunset of GMS1.4, it's released for free, for everyone, forever!

# Setup
It can happen that PEd uses different variables for object transformations than you have in you project. So before starting to use PEd, we recommend you to check if the variables are matching, otherwise you would not be able to use the editor. To do so, go to Macros > Default and you should see a short list of constants. Each constants represents a variable.

Macro              | Description
------------------ | -----------
`PEd_VAR_POS_X`    | Instance position on X axis
`PEd_VAR_POS_Y`    | Instance position on Y axis
`PEd_VAR_POS_Z*`   | Instance position on Z axis
`PEd_VAR_ROT_X*`   | Instance rotation around X axis
`PEd_VAR_ROT_Y*`   | Instance rotation around Y axis
`PEd_VAR_ROT_Z`    | Instance rotation around Z axis
`PEd_VAR_SCALE_X`  | Instance scale on X axis
`PEd_VAR_SCALE_Y`  | Instance scale on Y axis
`PEd_VAR_SCALE_Z*` | Instance scale on Z axis
`PEd_VAR_COLOUR`   | Instance colour
`PEd_VAR_ALPHA`    | Instance alpha

**List of automatically saved variables:**

 `x`, `y`, `image_angle`, `image_xscale`, `image_yscale`, `image_blend`, `image_alpha`

These variables are ALWAYS saved into the room file (both GM's native and external). Any other additional variable has to be written into instance's creation code. Writing variables into the creation code is done by `PEd_instanceAutocompleteCode`. Loading variables from creation code, which is necessary only for external "*.bbmap" room files (in GM's native rooms this is done automatically), is done in `PEd_assignVariable`. So if you make any changes to the constants, make sure that you have also rewritten variable names in those two scripts.

> \* - Additional variables, necessary only for 3D transformations. If you are using PEd for creating 2D levels, you can leave these constants as they are.
